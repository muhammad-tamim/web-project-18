## What I Learned New while Building This Project:
1. When i try to init the project i got this warnings: 

```bash
git muhammad-tamim@Inspiron-3421:~/programming/personal project/web-project-18$ git init
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint: 
hint:   git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint: 
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint: 
hint:   git branch -m <name>
```

so,i use, below command to make every new repo start with main instead of master.

```bash
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```
